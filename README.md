Tetris
</h1>
Above files contains our implementation of code, for game "Tetris". 
<br>
<br>

File 'TetrisConsole.c' is a quick demonstration of how our game should works. Feel free to compile it even via one of the online compilers and have a fun playing!

File 'TetrisAtmega.c' contains full code ready to be deployed at ATmega328P-PU.

About the code and components:
</h3>
As a team of a good frends with similar passion,  we wanted to make a quick and small project to test our skills with programming and electronics. We wanted to create a code which would be fast and take as little space as possible, so we decided that instead take a easy way by writting this code on two dimensional arrays we wrote it with use of registers.

It was quite an expirience mainly because we had a hard time with our displays which we had to change 2 times, due to their factory defects. However, at the end we are pride from the results (even that we have to change the display the 3rd time). 

The result as a 30 seconds video, you can check out here:
